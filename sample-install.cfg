* this is a sample install.cfg that I use
* Note although there is no formal comment line option, since * cannot be
* part of a valid windows directory, the line wil never match
* the non stared line below will copy a just built x86 release build files
* to the installRoot\prebuilt directory. This is something I do
* as a convience i.e. I share prebuilt win32 binaries
x86-Release,+prebuilt
* the next example will copy just built x64 release build files
* to a bin directory on my machine.
* As I have windows 64 I generally use the 64bit builds
x64-Release,d:\bin
* some other examples assuming the file to install is myfile.exe
* then for the respective builds shown below the following files will
* be stored in the installRoot\test directory
* x86-Release -> myfile32.exe
* x64-Release -> myfile.exe
* x86-Debug   -> myfile32_d.exe
* x64-Debuf   -> myfile_d.exe
x86-Release,+test,32
x64-Release,+test
x86-Debug,+test,32_d
x64-Debug,+test,_d
